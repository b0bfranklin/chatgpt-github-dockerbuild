## Authentication and Authorization

### GitHub OAuth Implementation

The application uses GitHub's OAuth 2.0 for authentication:

- **Secure Token Storage**: GitHub access tokens are stored in server-side sessions, never exposed to clients
- **Scoped Permissions**: OAuth scopes are limited to the minimum necessary permissions
- **Token Rotation**: Access tokens are refreshed according to GitHub's best practices
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All OAuth traffic is encrypted using TLS
- **Stateful Sessions**: Redis is used for secure session management

### Rate Limiting and Brute Force Protection

- **API Rate Limiting**: Configurable limits on request frequency to prevent abuse
- **Auth Endpoint Protection**: Stricter rate limits on authentication endpoints
- **Fail2Ban Integration**: Detection and blocking of suspicious IP addresses
- **Progressive Delays**: Increasing timeouts for repeated failed authentication attempts

## Data Protection

### Secrets Management

- **Docker Secrets**: Support for Docker secrets to protect sensitive credentials
- **Environmental Isolation**: Development and production environments are separated
- **Memory Protection**: Sensitive data is not logged or exposed in error messages
- **Secure Configuration**: Production credentials are never committed to source control

### Data Minimization

- **GitHub Access Scope**: Only the minimum required GitHub permissions are requested
- **Cache Control**: Sensitive data is not cached in browser storage
- **Data Retention**: User data is only stored as long as necessary

## Network Security

### TLS Implementation

- **Strong Ciphers**: Modern, secure cipher suites are enforced
- **TLS 1.2+**: Older, vulnerable TLS versions are disabled
- **HSTS**: HTTP Strict Transport Security is enabled
- **Certificate Management**: Automated certificate renewal via Let's Encrypt

### Firewall Configuration

- **Default Deny**: All ports are closed by default except those explicitly needed
- **Service Isolation**: Internal services are not exposed to the public internet
- **Traffic Filtering**: Incoming requests are validated before processing

## Docker Security

- **Minimal Base Images**: Uses slim, up-to-date base images
- **Non-Root User**: Application runs as a non-root user inside containers
- **Resource Limits**: Container resource utilization is constrained
- **Read-Only Filesystem**: Container filesystems are mounted read-only where possible
- **No Privileged Mode**: Containers run without privileged access

## Dependency Security

- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular automated scanning for vulnerable dependencies
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only necessary packages are installed
- **Version Pinning**: Dependencies are pinned to specific versions
- **Update Automation**: Security updates are automatically applied

## Monitoring and Logging

- **Security Event Logging**: Authentication attempts and sensitive operations are logged
- **Log Rotation**: Logs are rotated to prevent disk space exhaustion
- **Structured Logging**: JSON-formatted logs for easier analysis
- **IP Tracking**: Client IP addresses are logged for security auditing

## Secure Configuration

- **Security Headers**: HTTP security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.) are implemented
- **Secure Defaults**: All security features are enabled by default
- **Environment Validation**: Configuration is validated at startup
- **Fail Secure**: The application fails closed rather than open

## Security Hardening Checklist

Use this checklist to verify your deployment meets security requirements:

- [ ] SSL/TLS is properly configured and enforced
- [ ] GitHub OAuth credentials are stored securely
- [ ] Docker secrets are used for sensitive information
- [ ] Redis is password-protected and not exposed externally
- [ ] Firewall is configured to allow only necessary traffic
- [ ] Rate limiting is enabled for API endpoints
- [ ] Fail2Ban is configured to protect against brute force attacks
- [ ] Security headers are properly configured in Nginx
- [ ] Container is running as non-root user
- [ ] Logs are being captured and monitored for security events
- [ ] Dependencies are up-to-date and regularly scanned
- [ ] Automated security updates are enabled

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please contact the maintainers directly before creating a public GitHub issue. This allows us to address and fix the vulnerability before it is potentially exploited.
